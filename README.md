# Enhanced Mean-Variance Optimization Using Multi-Branch LSTM

This repository contains a report detailing the development and performance evaluation of an enhanced mean-variance optimization strategy utilizing a multi-branch Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for stock price prediction.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this report is to critically evaluate the integration of advanced machine learning techniques with traditional portfolio optimization methods. It provides a balanced analysis of the methodology, challenges, and comparative performance results between standard and enhanced approaches.

## Key Findings

*   **Standard MVO outperforms Enhanced MVO**: A simpler mean-variance optimization strategy with monthly rebalancing achieved superior results
*   **Computational efficiency as primary advantage**: The Multi-Branch LSTM approach offers efficient portfolio weight calculation for large-scale optimization
*   **Mixed performance results**: Enhanced MVO only marginally surpasses market average returns despite added complexity
*   **Robust standard approach**: Standard MVO demonstrated strong risk-adjusted performance with a Sharpe ratio of 2.90

## Model Confidentiality

**Please note**: The source code and specific details of the model architecture are not included in this repository. Due to the model's scalability and ongoing development, it is kept confidential.
